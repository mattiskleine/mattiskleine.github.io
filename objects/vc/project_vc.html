    <h1>UX of Virtual Conferencing</h1>
    <p>Improving the user experience in virtual conferencing systems through digital fidgeting, pixel-free slideshows & natural desktop behavior.</p>

    <h2>Natural Desktop Behavior</h2>
    <p>
      Everybody's desktop looks different (both computer and physical). Some say the desktop even represents
      the personality. People are most productive when they have their own personal working space.</br></br>
      Today's virtual conferencing systems generally have a static, synchronised UI with little or no
      customizability. The screen shows the current speaker, not necessarily what the user WANTS to look at.</br></br>
      This concept proposes a very free desktop behavior, where the user is in total control of the content he/she is viewing.
      That may be the speaker, some other participant, the presented slideshow, or some other shared screen.</br></br>
      The concept also proposes a more intuitive way to share screen content, allowing any user to publish any amount of
      screens and viewing any of the published screens at any time.

    <h2>Pixel-free Slideshows</h2>
    <p>
      Slideshow sharing through virtual conferencing systems used to be only possible by sharing the screen – a pixel based mpeg
      stream eating bandwidth, increasing latency, and reducing image quality. Long before Zoom introduced all their new functionalities and
      plugins, this project proposed a pixel-free solution for slideshow sharing in real time. The solution is not only
      more performant and of better quality, it also enables a range of interactive feautures (copy-paste, in-slide drawing, multiple choice)
      and an asynchronous presentation – allowing the audience to catch up on a missed slide for example.</br>
      The overall concept is not limited to slid

    <h2>Digital Fidgeting</h2>
    <p>
      A multitude of studies confirm the positive effects of fidgeting, doodling and fiddling on attention and awareness.
      Even though such behavior is not impossible during virtual conferencing, it is often replaced with multitasks
      that reduce attention instead of increasing it. This concept embeds digital fidgeting into the UI. See some digital
      fidgeting applications in Thomas Park's work!
